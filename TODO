Here's a list of things that the authors are working on in the short-term:

* mp4live:
	Re-encoding support.
	Xvid, H.26L, and DV support. 
	Exploit P4 SSE2 more.

* mp4player:
	mpeg2 transport streams

Here's a list of things that we would like to do in the future,
however we're happy to have volunteers do them also ;-)

* Support for DV in mp4live
* Support for v4l2 and bttv 0.8 in mp4live
* Update ISO MPEG-4 reference codec to latest version
* RTP insertion/failover intermediary
* RSVP support
* Port, port, port...

Further suggestions are of course welcome, 
especially if you're willing to implement them!
