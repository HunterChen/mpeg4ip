Here's a list of things that the authors are working on in the short-term:

* Windows port
* Add the OpenDivX MPEG-4 video codec as an option
* Add an MP3 audio codec as an option

Here's a list of things that we would like to do in the future,
however we're happy to have volunteers do them also ;-)

* Port, port, port...
* Integrate with other player skins like XMPS
* Add the MPEG-4 CELP audio codec (low bitrate voice codec)
* Add ability to easily tune into multicasts (the plumbing is all there)

Further suggestions are of course welcome, 
especially if you're willing to implement them!
