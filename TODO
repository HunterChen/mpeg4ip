Here's a list of things that the authors are working on in the short-term:

* Interoperabilty
* New MP4 file library
* Firewall traversal

Here's a list of things that we would like to do in the future,
however we're happy to have volunteers do them also ;-)

* Port, port, port...
* Add the MPEG-4 CELP audio codec (low bitrate voice codec)

Further suggestions are of course welcome, 
especially if you're willing to implement them!
