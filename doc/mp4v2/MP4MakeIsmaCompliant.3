.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
\fBMP4MakeIsmaCompliant\fR modifies an mp4 file so that it complies with the minimal MPEG\-4 Systems requirements defined by the Internet Streaming Media Alliance (ISMA, http://www.isma.tv)
.LP 
This involves creating an OD and Scene track, and using them to describe a simple scene of one audio, or one video, or one of each. An SDP version of this information is also added to the mp4 file.
.LP 
Caveat: whether the file is truly ISMA compliant also depends on the contents of the media and hint tracks. This function does not guarantee that these tracks are compliant.
