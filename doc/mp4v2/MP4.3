.TH "MP4" "3" "Version 0.9" "Cisco Systems Inc." "MP4 File Format Library"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
The MP4 library provides an API to create and modify mp4 files as defined by ISO\-IEC:14496\-1:2001 MPEG\-4 Systems. This file format is derived from Apple's QuickTime file format that has been used as a multimedia file format in a variety of platforms and applications. It is a very powerful and extensible format that can accomodate practically any type of media.
.LP 
The basic structure of an mp4 file is that the file is a container for one or more tracks. These tracks contain one type of media, such as audio or video. Each track has its own timeline, samples, and properties. (An example of a sample is a frame of video.) The file describes how to synchronize the timelines of the tracks and the aggregate properties of the tracks.
.SH "INVOCATION"
.LP 
The libary API is defined in <mp4.h> which includes all the necessary dependent include files.
.LP 
The MP4 library can be used by either C or C++ programs. The calling convention is C, but if C++ is used then the default argument feature of that language can be used. E.g.
.br 
	MP4Create("foo.mp4", 0, 0, 0); /* OK in C++ and C */
.br 
	MP4Create("foo.mp4"); /* OK in C++, ERROR in C */
.SH "EXAMPLES"
See mpeg4ip/lib/mp4v2/util and mpeg4ip/lib/mp4v2/test for simple example programs that use the MP4 library.
.LP 
In particular:
.br 
	mp4nullcreate.cpp 
.br 
	Program that creates an empty mp4 file.
.LP 
	mp4dump.cpp	
.br 
	Simple program to print a text version of an mp4 file
.LP 
	mp4extract.cpp 
.br 
	Program to read each track and sample and place them in a separate file to ease inspection or recombination.
.LP 
	mp4nullvplayer.cpp
.br 
	Program that reads the video track but doesn't actuall render the video.

For more complete applications that uses the MP4 library see mpeg4ip/server/mp4creator, mpeg4ip/server/mp4live, and mpeg4ip/player/src.
