TODO list for the 1.2 release:

 * DirectInput joystick support needs to be implemented
 * Resizable windows on MacOS need to be implemented
 * Be able to enumerate and select available audio and video drivers
 * Use /etc/fb.modes, if available, like GGI does
 * Official support for MacOS X

In the jump from 1.1 to 1.2, we should change the SDL_Rect members to
int and evaluate all the rest of the datatypes.  This is the only place
we should do it though, since the 1.1 series should not break binary
compatibility in this way.
