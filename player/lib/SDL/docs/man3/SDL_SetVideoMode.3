.SH "NAME"
SDL_SetVideoMode\- Set up a video mode with the specified width, height and bits-per-pixel\&.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fB#include "SDL\&.h"
.sp
\fBSDL_Surface *\fBSDL_SetVideoMode\fP\fR(\fBint width, int height, int bpp, Uint32 flags\fR);
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Set up a video mode with the specified width, height and bits-per-pixel\&.
.PP
If \fBbpp\fR is 0, it is treated as the current display bits per pixel\&.
.PP
The \fBflags\fR parameter is the same as the \fBflags\fR field of the \fI\fBSDL_Surface\fR\fR structure\&. OR\&'d combinations of the following values are valid\&.
.TP 20
\fBSDL_SWSURFACE\fP
Create the video surface in system memory
.TP 20
\fBSDL_HWSURFACE\fP
Create the video surface in video memory
.TP 20
\fBSDL_ASYNCBLIT\fP
Enables the use of asynchronous to the display surface\&. This will usually slow down blitting on single CPU machines, but may provide a speed increase on SMP systems\&.
.TP 20
\fBSDL_ANYFORMAT\fP
Allow and video depth/pixel-format and emulated it if its not supported by the display\&.
.TP 20
\fBSDL_HWPALETTE\fP
Give SDL exclusive palette access\&. Without this flag you may not always get the the colors you request with \fI\fBSDL_SetColors\fP\fR\&.
.TP 20
\fBSDL_DOUBLEBUF\fP
Enable double buffering\&. Calling \fI\fBSDL_Flip\fP\fR will flip the buffers and update the screen\&. If double buffering could not be enabled then \fBSDL_Flip\fP will just perform a \fI\fBSDL_UpdateRect\fP\fR on the entire screen\&.
.TP 20
\fBSDL_FULLSCREEN\fP
SDL will attempt to use a fullscreen mode
.TP 20
\fBSDL_OPENGL\fP
Create an OpenGL rendering context\&. You should have previously set OpenGL video attributes with \fI\fBSDL_GL_SetAttribute\fP\fR\&.
.TP 20
\fBSDL_OPENGLBLIT\fP
Create an OpenGL rendering context, like above, but allow normal blitting operations\&.
.TP 20
\fBSDL_RESIZABLE\fP
Create a resizable window\&. When the window is resized by the user a \fI\fBSDL_VIDEORESIZE\fP\fR event is generated and \fBSDL_SetVideoMode\fP can be called again with the new size\&.
.PP
.RS
\fBNote:  
.PP
Whatever \fBflags\fR \fBSDL_SetVideoMode\fP could satisfy are set in the \fBflags\fR member of the returned surface\&.
.RE
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
The framebuffer surface, or \fBNULL\fR if it fails\&.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
\fI\fBSDL_LockSurface\fP\fR, \fI\fBSDL_SetColors\fP\fR, \fI\fBSDL_Flip\fP\fR, \fI\fBSDL_Surface\fR\fR
