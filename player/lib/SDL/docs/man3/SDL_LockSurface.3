.SH "NAME"
SDL_LockSurface\- Lock a surface for directly access\&.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fB#include "SDL\&.h"
.sp
\fBint \fBSDL_LockSurface\fP\fR(\fBSDL_Surface *surface\fR);
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBSDL_LockSurface\fP sets up a surface for directly accessing the pixels\&. Between calls to \fBSDL_LockSurface\fP and \fBSDL_UnlockSurface\fP, you can write to and read from \fBsurface->\fBpixels\fR\fR, using the pixel format stored in \fBsurface->\fBformat\fR\fR\&. Once you are done accessing the surface, you should use \fBSDL_UnlockSurface\fP to release it\&.
.PP
Not all surfaces require locking\&. If \fBSDL_MUSTLOCK\fP(\fBsurface\fR) evaluates to \fB0\fR, then you can read and write to the surface at any time, and the pixel format of the surface will not change\&. 
.PP
No operating system or library calls should be made between lock/unlock pairs, as critical system locks may be held during this time\&.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
\fBSDL_LockSurface\fP returns \fB0\fR, or \fB-1\fR if the surface couldn\&'t be locked\&.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
