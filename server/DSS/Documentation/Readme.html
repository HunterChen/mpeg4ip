   <H3>About Darwin Streaming Server</H3>
   
   <H4>QuickTime Streaming Server</H4>
   
   <P>QuickTime Streaming Server on Mac OS X Server lets you stream
   digital video on the Internet using industry-standard Internet
   protocols RTP and RTSP. Using QuickTime Streaming Server you can
   serve stored files (video on demand) or reflect live broadcasts to
   thousands of QuickTime 4 users. With its combination of
   industry-standard streaming protocols and cutting-edge compression
   technologies, QuickTime 4 delivers perfectly synchronized audio
   and video streams ideal for Internet video and live events.</P>
   
   <H4>Darwin Streaming Server</H4>
   
   <P>Apple has pledged to make the QuickTime Streaming Server source
   code available to whoever wants to improve it. Darwin Streaming
   Server is the open source release of the QuickTime Streaming
   Server product. The Darwin Streaming Server open source gives
   developers the flexibility to easily improve and extend QuickTime
   digital video streaming to meet their needs.</P>
   
   <P>This package includes source files for a streaming server that
   can serve both on-disk QuickTime files and can reflect a live
   broadcast. It does not include source code for the server
   administration software used on Mac OS X Server.</P>
   
   <P>&nbsp;</P>
   
   <H3>What's New in Darwin Streaming Server 2.0.1</H3>
   
   <P>Darwin Streaming Server 2.0.1 addresses several product and
   Open Source issues and provides general product enhancements such
   as:</P>
   
   <UL>
      <LI>Improved logging of client error messages.</LI>
      
      <LI>Improved server CPU performance when serving non-optimized
      hinted QuickTime movies.</LI>
   </UL>
   
   <P>It also fixes this problem:</P>
   
   <UL>
      <LI>Unwanted clicks on audio tracks, especially when a file
      isn't optimized for streaming.</LI>
   </UL>
   
   <P>Standard Features in the Darwin Streaming Server 2.0.x release
   include the following:</P>
   
   <UL>
      <LI>Accessibility - You can stream media using RTP and RTSP
      over HTTP in addition to UDP. This means users can view media
      through most firewalls.</LI>
      
      <LI>Relay Support - You can replicate content for live
      broadcasts. With relays, you can scale streaming services to
      reach more viewers.</LI>
      
      <LI>Enhanced Logging - The Darwin Streaming Server software now
      supports third-party analysis tools that provide consolidated
      server reporting.</LI>
      
      <LI>Authentication Support - You can control access to media
      files using the authentication modules that come with Darwin
      Streaming Server software, or you can supply your own
      module.</LI>
      
      <LI>Module API - The Darwin Streaming Server software now
      supports dynamically loadable modules which can extend the
      functionality of the server through the QTSS API.</LI>
   </UL>
   
   <P>&nbsp;</P>

   Streaming Server web page</A>.</P>
   
   <P>&nbsp;</P>
   
   <H3>Mailing List</H3>
   
   <P>To receive information about QuickTime Streaming Server
   updates, join the QuickTime Streaming Server mailing list. Through
   the list you can share experiences, questions, and comments with
   others who use the software. Apple employees may monitor the list,
   but Apple does not guarantee that questions sent to this list will
   be answered. For more information about joining the mailing list,
   see the Apple mailing lists Web site at <A HREF="http://www.lists.apple.com/">www.lists.apple.com</A>.</P>
   
   <P>&nbsp;</P>
   
   <H3>Platform Support</H3>
   
   <P>The Darwin Streaming Server source currently compiles and runs
   on the following platforms:</P>
   
   <UL>
      <LI>Mac OS X Server</LI>
      
      <LI>Linux (RedHat 5.2 - 6.2, GlibC 2.1.3 recommended)</LI>
      
      <LI>Solaris 7 (SunOS 5.7)</LI>
      
      <LI>FreeBSD 3.4 (Intel)</LI>
   </UL>
   
   <P>It can be ported to other platforms by modifying a handful of
   platform specific source files. For more information on the source
   code and on porting the source, see the files AboutTheSource.html
   and SourceFAQ.html.</P>
   
   <P>&nbsp;</P>
   
   <P>&nbsp;</P>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Binary Packages</B></FONT></P>
   
   <P>Binary packages for the platforms listed above (other than Mac
   OS X Server) are available for download from the <A HREF="http://www.publicsource.apple.com/projects/streaming/">Darwin
   Streaming Server web page</A>. These binary packages include the
   DarwinStreamingServer, a sample streamingserver.conf file,
   PlaylistBroadcaster, StreamingProxy (an RTSP Proxy Server), a
   sample QTSSAccessModule that provides authentication features, a
   100kbit hinted "sample.mov".</P>
   
   <P>Also included with the Darwin Streaming Server is rtspam, a
   stress tool for testing the server. rtspam realistically simulates
   many RTSP clients viewing a movie from the server. The tool offers
   many command-line options that can create different types of
   simulations. Typing ./rtspam will print a description of all
   available options.</P>
   
   <P>rtspam will only work if there is a movie called "rtspam.mov"
   in the root movie folder of the target server. This file must be a
   valid, hinted QuickTime movie.</P>
   
   <P>&nbsp;</P>
   
   <H3>Installation</H3>
   
   <P>&#91;NOTE: For Windows NT/2000 Server install instructions
   please see the "ReadMeNT.txt" file.&#93;</P>
   
   <P>From a terminal window perform the following steps:</P>
   
   <OL>
      <LI>Log in as "root"</LI>
      
      <LI>"cd" into the DarwinStreamingServer2 directory and type:
      
      <P><TT>./Install</TT></P></LI>
      
      <LI>Once the install script completes type:
      
      <P><TT>DarwinStreamingServer </TT></P></LI>
   </OL>
   
   <H3>What Gets Installed</H3>
   
   <P>Running the ./Install script places the following files and
   directories onto your system:</P>
   
   <UL>
      <LI>/usr/local/sbin/DarwinStreamingServer</LI>
      
      <LI>/usr/local/sbin/PlaylistBroadcaster</LI>
      
      <LI>/usr/local/sbin/StreamingServerModules/QTSSAccessModule</LI>
      
      <LI>/usr/local/sbin/qtpasswd</LI>
      
      <LI>/etc/streamingserver.conf</LI>
      
      <LI>/etc/streamingrelay.conf</LI>
      
      <LI>/var/streaming/logs/</LI>
      
      <LI>/usr/local/movies/sample.mov</LI>
   </UL>
   
   <P>&nbsp;</P>
   
   <H3>Configuration and Testing</H3>
   
   <P>The server serves all streaming content out of its "media
   folder". By default, this media folder is located at /usr/local/movies/.
   This path is one of the preferences in the config file (or in
   NetInfo on Mac OS X). If you want your media folder to be located
   somewhere else, you must edit the "movie_folder" preference before
   starting the server.</P>
   
   <P>In order to enable streaming of media using RTP and RTSP over
   HTTP, add port 80 to the "rtsp_port" preference.</P>
   
   <P>Once you have a media folder, you can place streaming media
   into the folder. All QuickTime files must be "hinted" with
   QuickTime Player Pro or other QuickTime authoring applications
   before they can be streamed. Once the movie is hinted, copy the
   file to the streaming media folder on your server.</P>
   
   <P>There is a sample movie that comes with each package. The
   sample movie is already hinted, so you can place it into your
   media folder. From the QuickTime client, attempt to access that
   movie through an rtsp URL (e.g. rtsp://my.server.com/sample.mov),
   and the server will stream that movie to the client.</P>
   
   <P>In order to "reflect" a live broadcast, you must setup and
   start a broadcaster application, such as the Sorenson Broadcaster.
   The broadcaster produces an SDP file that describes the live
   broadcast. Place that SDP file into your media folder, access the
   URL from a QuickTime Client, and the server will "reflect" the
   live broadcast to the client.</P>
   
   <P>For more information about authoring, hinting, and streaming
   QuickTime media, refer to the QuickTime Streaming Server
   documentation.</P>
   
   <P>&nbsp;</P>
   
   <H3>Modifying Configuration Files</H3>
   
   <P>If you enter a string that includes spaces in a configuration
   file, you must put quotations marks around the string.</P>
   
   <P>For example, "My Streaming Server" instead of My Streaming
   Server.</P>
