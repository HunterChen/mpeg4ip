						<P><FONT FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2">A Session Description Protocol (SDP) file is usually created by broadcaster software. For live streaming, SDP files are created on the capture and encoding computer by software such as Sorenson Broadcaster. For broadcasts of prerecorded media, an SDP file is created on your Darwin Streaming Server by PlaylistBroadcaster. To stream either live or prerecorded media, the SDP file must be copied to the <A HREF="ss05.htm">media directory you've designated</A> in the Darwin Streaming Server configuration file. </FONT></P>
						<P><FONT FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2">The SDP file contains information about the format, timing, and authorship of the streamed media. In most cases you should not modify this file manually. However, if you change anything about the media you're streaming, you must delete the SDP file, let the broadcasting software create a new SDP file, then copy the SDP file to the media directory on your Darwin Streaming Server. </FONT></P>
						<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#330099"><B>IMPORTANT:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2"> If an SDP file already exists, the broadcast software will not create a new SDP file, even if you've made changes to the media you want to stream. You must delete the outdated SDP file for a new one to be created.</FONT></P>
