						<P><FONT FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2">Darwin Streaming Server sends data using User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets. Firewalls designed to protect information on a network often block UDP packets. Client computers located behind a firewall that blocks UDP packets are unable to receive streamed media. However, Darwin Streaming Server also allows streaming data to be sent over HTTP connections, which allows streamed media to be viewed through even very tightly configured firewalls.</FONT></P>
						<P><FONT FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2">If users are having problems viewing media through a firewall, they should upgrade their QuickTime software to the latest version. If users still have problems, their firewall administrator should provide them with the appropriate settings for the Streaming Proxy and Streaming Transport panels of the QuickTime Settings control panel. </FONT></P>
