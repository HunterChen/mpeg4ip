						<P>To see the General settings, click Settings in Streaming Server Admin, then click General Settings.<BR>
						<BR>
						&quot;Movies Directory&quot; contains the media files available to streaming server clients. The files must be properly formatted streaming media files or links to such files. The media files and links must be located in the movies directory or any of its subdirectories.<BR>
						<BR>
						&quot;Authentication Scheme&quot; lets you choose between Basic or Digest. By default, the server uses the more secure Digest authentication. However, Digest authentication requires that users connect with QuickTime 5 or later. Basic authentication is less secure than Digest but is compatible with earlier versions of QuickTime.<BR>
						<BR>
						&quot;Streaming on Port 80&quot; lets you specify whether you want to serve QuickTime streams over HTTP port 80. If you need to serve streams past firewalls, you may need to enable streaming on port 80.<BR>
						<BR>
						&quot;Maximum Number of Connections&quot; lets you set the maximum number of connections. When the maximum number of connections is reached, users who try to connect see a message that the server is busy (error 453).<BR>
						<BR>
						&quot;Maximum Throughput&quot; lets you set the maximum throughput of the server. If the maximum throughput is reached, no one else can connect. Users who try to connect see a message that the server is busy (error 453).<BR>
						<BR>
						&quot;Administrator's New Password&quot; lets you change the server administrator's login password (you cannot change this remotely).<BR>
						<BR>
						&quot;Re-enter Administrator's New Password&quot; confirms any change to the server administrator's login password.</P>
