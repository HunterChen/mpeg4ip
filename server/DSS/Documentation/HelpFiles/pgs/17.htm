						<P>To see playlist settings, click Settings in Streaming Server Admin, click Playlists Settings, and then click the name of the playlist whose settings you want to see.<BR>
						<BR>
						&quot;Playlist Name&quot; is the name you give your playlist and the name that appears in the Playlists Settings pane.<BR>
						<BR>
						&quot;Playlist URL&quot; is the name you give to clients who want to view the playlist broadcast (or that you embed in a Web page). It is the same as the name in the Playlist Name field. Spaces are automatically converted to underscores and &quot;.sdp&quot; is appended to the name of the file. You don't have to enter a playlist URL. It is generated when you click Submit. If you want to change it later, you can.<BR>
						<BR>
						&quot;Play Mode&quot; can be one of three choices:<BR>

								<TD WIDTH="302">&quot;Weighted Random&quot; broadcasts the media in random order using the specified weights to determine how often an item plays. The higher the number, the more weight it carries. The media continues to play in random order until you stop the broadcast.</TD>
							</TR>
						</TABLE><BR>
						&quot;Items only repeat after _ other items have played&quot; lets you set the number of items that must play before an item can repeat. If you set a value other than zero for repeated items, make sure the number is less than the number of media files in the playlist.<BR>
						<BR>
						Click the Add/Remove Items button to add items to your playlist. After you're done, make sure you return to the Details pane to set the order and weight for each item.<BR>

						You can also enable logging for each playlist by clicking the Enable Logging checkbox.</P>
