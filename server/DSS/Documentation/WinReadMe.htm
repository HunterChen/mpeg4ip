<P><FONT SIZE="+1">To install and set up Darwin Streaming Server
Public Preview software, follow these steps on the server
computer:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">When the Server package is unzipped, a folder with
Darwin Streaming Server and associated files will be created. Inside
this folder is an Install script, named "Install.bat". Double-click
this file to install the server and its components on the server
machine. The installer also starts up the Streaming Server Admin, so
keep the command prompt window open.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Darwin Streaming Server source code currently
compiles and runs on the following platforms:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><UL>
      <LI><FONT SIZE="+1">Mac OS X</FONT></LI>
      
      <LI><FONT SIZE="+1">Linux (RedHat 6.2, Intel)</FONT></LI>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">It can be ported to other platforms by modifying a
handful of platform specific source files. For more information on
the source code and on porting the source, see the files
AboutTheSource.html and SourceFAQ.html.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica"><B>Troubleshooting</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&#149; If the Streaming Server Admin is not
responding, you should verify that the streamingadminserver.pl script
is running first. This can be done by opening up the task manager and
looking for perl process. If not, launch the Admin by typing 'perl
"c:\Program Files\Darwin Streaming Server\streamingadminserver.pl"'
at the command prompt. The Streaming Server Admin process is attached
to a command window, so closing it will cause the process to quit.
Make sure that the command window from which the Streaming Server
Admin is started remains open.</FONT></P>
