The .mov files generated by the server side tools are designed to be served by Apple's Quicktime Streaming Server (QTSS) or compatible. To download the server, see http://www.apple.com/quicktime 

If you are using the Apple QTSS and have downloaded the source code, then you should apply the patch contained in ./patch01. It fixes a problem, where the RTP timestamps for video streams that use bidirectional coded frames (aka B-frames) are incorrect.
